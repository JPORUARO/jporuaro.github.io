  <p class="para">This collection is about the art work which i did in my secondary school between year 10 and 11.
     The big drawing and the 4 painted images (which are identical) are based on a character called "Heuy Freeman" from a TV show (The Boondocks). </p>

     <p class="para">The drawing next to the egyptian painting consist of an egyptian thene and Jesus (which explains the hair style and crown of thorns).
        The other images which has a man and a woman are one of my best art work. The style is from the artist "Roy Lichtenstein" which was one of the greatest artist in the world with is cartoonish art style.</p>
